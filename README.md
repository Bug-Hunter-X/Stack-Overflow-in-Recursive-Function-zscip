This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow. The `bug.py` file contains a recursive function that calculates Fibonacci numbers.  For larger inputs (e.g., n=35), the recursion depth exceeds the system's limit, resulting in a stack overflow error. The `bugSolution.py` file presents a solution using dynamic programming to avoid the recursion depth issue.
